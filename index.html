				<h3> This chart shows the most amount of <br>gold medal is from CANADA in 2014 </h3>
					<p>Canada competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, from February 7 to 23, 2014. Canadians competed in every discipline except Nordic combined.

					The 2014 Games marked the first time a Canadian Olympic team competed in Russia, as Canada and 64 western countries did not take part at the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow due to the Soviet–Afghan War.
					<br>


					Canada originally finished these Olympics with 10 gold medals and 25 overall (ranking 2nd and 3rd respectively). This is the second most successful Canadian performance ever, exceeded only by the achievements at the home Olympics in Vancouver in 2010. With the belated luge medal awarded in 2017 after a Russian doping disqualification, Canada briefly tied its Vancouver performance in total medal count. However, the IOC decision was overturned on appeal, bumping the Canadian team back to fourth and the total medal count back to 2nd and 3rd.</p>

				<h3>Which sport won the most medals?</h3>
					<p>Canada has sent athletes to every Winter Olympic Games and almost every Summer Olympic Games since its debut at the 1900 games with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics, which it boycotted. Canada has won at least one medal at every Olympics in which it has competed. The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) is the National Olympic Committee for Canada.
					At the 2010 Winter Olympics, which was hosted in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the country won more gold medals than any other competing nation for the first time.</p>

				<h3> The amount of total three medals in Canada <br>from 1924 to 2014</h3>
					<p>The COC’s Athlete Excellence Fund (AEF) is a support and reward program that provides Canadian athletes with performance awards of $20,000, $15,000 and $10,000 for winning Olympic gold, silver or bronze medals respectively. It also provides funding of $5,000 for performances at World Championships (or equivalent) during non-Olympic years, to support living, training, and competition expenses.

					The COC first introduced the concept of a direct athlete support and incentive program with its ‘Athlete Fund’ in 1997. In 2003, the Athlete Fund transitioned into what was known as the Performance Recognition Support Program (PRSP) and awarded $5,000 to each Canadian athlete finishing in the top-5 at World Championships or Olympic Games.

					The AEF was created in 2006 and is an evolution of the PRSP. The Athletes’ Commission developed the criteria for the AEF, which was then approved by the COC’s Executive Committee.</p>

				<h3> Participation of women in the Olympics in four countries</h3>
					<p>The rate of participation of women in the Olympic Games has been increasing since their first participation in 1900. Some sports are uniquely for women, others are contested by both sexes, while some older sports remain for men only. Studies of media coverage of the Olympics consistently show differences in the ways in which women and men are described and the ways in which their performances are discussed. The representation of women on the International Olympic Committee has run well behind the rate of female participation, and it continues to miss its target of a 20% minimum presence of women on their committee.</p>
